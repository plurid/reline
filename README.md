    Web Elements Generator and Conductor

# Why

Another Web Framework mostly because, with regards to the internet and the browser, we haven't even started discovering what it is about. And so, we need to reiterate on the same ideas, over and over again, until light is shed upon what is the nature of a set of pixels in the space of the browser.

However, there is another, more reasonal, reason: to have control over the entire rendering pipeline of [plurid](https://github.com/plurid/plurid) a new framework is needed, one that has learned from the wounds of the previous attempts, and that is straightforwardly focused on the cutting-edge (no support for anything prehistoric - that is, below the last 2 versions).

`Reline` is hugely inspired from and indebted to `React`.


# Generator

`Reline` can generate new Web Elements using `JSX`.


# Conductor

`Reline` handles the flow of data and behavior between the Web Elements and the external world (the network, the user).
